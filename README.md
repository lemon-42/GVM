# VM in Golang

## Introduction 

This project is a simple virtual machine implemented in Golang that operates using a stack. The purpose is to demonstrate basic concepts of virtual machines and stack-based computation.

## Purpose

Create a sample of how a virtual machine works in Golang using a stack.

## Actual instruction 

- `Push` : Push a value onto the top of the stack.
- `Pop` : Pop a value off the top of the stack.
- `Add` : Add the top two values on the stack.
- `Sub` : Subtract the top value from the second top value on the stack.
- `Mul` : Multiply the top two values on the stack.
- `Div` : Divide the second top value on the stack by the top value.
- `Mod` : Apply the modulo operation to the top two values on the stack (second by first).
- `And` : Perform a bitwise AND operation on the top two values on the stack. 
- `Or` : Perform a bitwise OR operation on the top two values on the stack. 
- `Not` : Perform a bitwise NOT operation on the top value on the stack.
